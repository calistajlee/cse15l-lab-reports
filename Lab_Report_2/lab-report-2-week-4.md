![Symtom of failure-inducing input](Change1Symptom.png)

The symptom is the faulty program behavior that I can see, which was the out of memory error that I saw when I compiled and ran my code. The failure-inducing input was having a new line after my line of code. The bug is that the program did not account for ignoring new lines that had no code in it.
