# Week 8 Lab Report

**A link to your markdown-parse repository and a link to the one you reviewed in week 7:**

* [My repository](https://github.com/calistajlee/lab6-markdown-parser)
* [The repository I reviewed](https://github.com/calistajlee/markdown-parse-peer-review)
---

**For each test above:**

* **Decide on what it should produce (i.e., expected output) by using either VScode preview or the CommonMark demo site**
**Showing the code in MarkdownParseTest.java for how you turned it into a test**

These pictures show the expected output in VS Code.

This is my code in MarkdownParseTest.java and it shows how I turned it into JUnit tests.

* **For your implementation, the corresponding output when running the tests; if it passed, say so. If it didn’t pass, show the specific part of the JUnit output that shows the test failure.**
**For the implementation you reviewed in Week 7, the corresponding output when running the tests; if it passed, say so. If it didn’t pass, show the specific part of the JUnit output that shows the test failure.**

For my implementation, this is the corresponding output when running the tests. It failed all three tests.

**Answer the following questions with 2-3 sentences each:**

* **Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 1 and all related cases that use inline code with backticks? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.**


* **Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 2 and all related cases that nest parentheses, brackets, and escaped brackets? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.**


* **Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 3 and all related cases that have newlines in brackets and parentheses? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.**
